# algorithm problem solving

This repository is for problem solving for developing solving algorithm skills.
I used python to solve problems, and as I wrote in the annotation, problems I solved in these repository are usually Korean, and is from SWexpertacademy probelms list. I organized files same as SWexpertacademy programming advanced course did, just to make it clean.

I used python 3.6 usually.

Finished all the problems from this course.
